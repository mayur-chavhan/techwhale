Let‚Äôs dive in! üöÄ</p><h2 id=\"why-this-matters-for-real-world-projects\">Why This Matters (For Real-World Projects)</h2>\n<p>In modern development environments, building container images inside Kubernetes clusters has become increasingly necessary. But running Docker inside containers creates security vulnerabilities and permission nightmares.</p><p><strong>Kaniko</strong> <em>(think of it as your robot assistant that builds containers without the usual Docker overhead)</em> solves this problem elegantly. Instead of requiring the Docker daemon, it executes container image builds in a standard Kubernetes pod, making your CI/CD pipeline more secure and flexible.</p><p>For production teams, this means:</p><ul>\n<li>No more privileged containers just to build images</li>\n<li>Streamlined build process inside your existing Kubernetes infrastructure</li>\n<li>More consistent deployments across development and production</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For solo developers, you‚Äôll save countless hours debugging permission issues while keeping your deployment process clean and reproducible.

You‚Äôve successfully deployed a Node.js application to Kubernetes using Kaniko. No more privileged containers or Docker-in-Docker headaches! This approach gives you a more secure and flexible way to build container images directly within your Kubernetes ecosystem.</p><p>Remember, DevOps isn‚Äôt just about following steps‚Äîit‚Äôs about understanding why each piece matters and how they all fit together to create a smooth deployment pipeline. By using Kaniko, you‚Äôve leveled up your Kubernetes game and made your deployments more secure.</p><p>What other containerization tools would you like to try with Kubernetes?

It allows you to quickly and easily perform repetitive tasks across multiple servers with minimal human intervention. Ansible is a popular automation tool that enables you to automate the initial server setup of multiple Ubuntu 22.04 servers with ease.</p><p>In this guide, we will walk you through the steps to automate the initial server setup of multiple Ubuntu 22.04 servers using Ansible. We will cover the installation of Ansible, creating an inventory file, configuring SSH access, setting up sudo access, and installing some common packages.</p><h2 id=\"prerequisites\">Prerequisites</h2>\n<p>Before we begin, you will need the following:</p><ul>\n<li>Multiple Ubuntu 22.04 servers.</li>\n<li>A user account with sudo privileges on each server.</li>\n<li>Ansible installed on your local machine.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"step-1-installing-ansible\">Step 1: Installing Ansible</h2>\n<p>Ansible is not installed by default on Ubuntu 22.04. To install Ansible on your local machine, follow these steps:</p><ol>\n<li>Open a terminal window on your local machine.</li>\n<li>Update the package lists and install Ansible with the following command:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>sudo apt update\nsudo apt install ansible\n</code></pre>\n<ol>\n<li>Verify that Ansible is installed by running the following command:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>ansible --version\n</code></pre>\n<p>You should see the version of Ansible that you installed.</p><h2 id=\"step-2-creating-an-inventory-file\">Step 2: Creating an Inventory File</h2>\n<p>The inventory file is a list of all the servers that Ansible should manage. This file is written in INI format and can be located anywhere on your local machine. To create an inventory file, follow these steps:</p><ol>\n<li>Open a terminal window on your local machine.</li>\n<li>Create a new text file with the following command:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>nano inventory.ini\n</code></pre>\n<ol>\n<li>Add the IP addresses or hostnames of each server to the file, one per line:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>[webserver]\n192.168.1.101\n192.168.1.102\n\n[database]\n192.168.1.103\n192.168.1.104\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this example, we have two groups of servers: webserver and database. The IP addresses of the servers in each group are listed below the group name.</p><ol>\n<li>Save and close the file.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"step-3-configuring-ssh-access\">Step 3: Configuring SSH Access</h2>\n<p>In order for Ansible to manage your servers, it needs to be able to connect to them using SSH. To configure SSH access, follow these steps:</p><ol>\n<li>Generate an SSH key pair on your local machine with the following command:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>ssh-keygen\n</code></pre>\n<ol>\n<li>Copy the public key to each server with the following command:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>ssh-copy-id username@server_ip_address\n</code></pre>\n<ol>\n<li>Test that you can connect to each server with the following command:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>ssh username@server_ip_address\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"step-4-setting-up-sudo-access\">Step 4: Setting Up Sudo Access</h2>\n<p>In order to perform certain tasks, such as installing packages, Ansible needs to be able to run commands with sudo privileges. To set up sudo access, follow these steps:</p><ol>\n<li>Open a terminal window on each server.</li>\n<li>Add your user account to the sudo group with the following command:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>sudo usermod -aG sudo username\n</code></pre>\n<ol>\n<li>Test that your user account has sudo access with the following command:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>sudo whoami\n</code></pre>\n<p>You should see ‚Äúroot‚Äù as the output.</p><h2 id=\"step-5-installing-common-packages\">Step 5: Installing Common Packages</h2>\n<p>Now that Ansible is set up and configured to manage your servers, we can install some common packages. To do this, we will create a playbook.</p><ol>\n<li>Create a new text file with the following command:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>nano playbook.yml\n</code></pre>\n<ol>\n<li>Add the following code to the file:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>---\n- name: Install common packages\n  hosts: all\n  become: true\n  tasks:\n    - name: Update package lists\n      apt:\n        update_cache: yes\n\n    - name: Install packages\n      apt:\n        name:\n          - nano\n          - git\n          - curl\n          - wget\n</code></pre>\n<p>This playbook will update the package lists and install the Nano, Git, Curl, and Wget packages on all servers in the inventory file.</p><ol>\n<li>Save and close the file.</li>\n<li>Run the playbook with the following command:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini playbook.yml\n</code></pre>\n<p>Ansible will connect to each server, update the package lists, and install the specified packages.</p><h2 id=\"step-6-creating-a-custom-user\">Step 6: Creating a Custom User</h2>\n<p>By default, Ubuntu 22.04 comes with a user named ‚Äúubuntu‚Äù. It is recommended that you create a custom user with a unique username and password for security reasons. To create a new user, follow these steps:</p><ol>\n<li>Open a terminal window on each server.</li>\n<li>Create a new user with the following command, replacing ‚Äúnewuser‚Äù with your desired username:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>sudo adduser newuser\n</code></pre>\n<ol>\n<li>Set a password for the new user when prompted.</li>\n<li>Add the new user to the sudo group with the following command:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>sudo usermod -aG sudo newuser\n</code></pre>\n<ol>\n<li>Test that the new user has sudo access with the following command:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>sudo whoami\n</code></pre>\n<p>You should see ‚Äúroot‚Äù as the output.</p><h2 id=\"step-7-configuring-firewall\">Step 7: Configuring Firewall</h2>\n<p>A firewall is an essential security tool that prevents unauthorized access to your servers. Ubuntu 22.04 comes with UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) pre-installed. To configure UFW, follow these steps:</p><ol>\n<li>Open a terminal window on each server.</li>\n<li>Enable UFW with the following command:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>sudo ufw enable\n</code></pre>\n<ol>\n<li>Allow SSH access with the following command:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>sudo ufw allow ssh\n</code></pre>\n<ol>\n<li>Allow HTTP and HTTPS access (if applicable) with the following command:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>sudo ufw allow http\nsudo ufw allow https\n</code></pre>\n<ol>\n<li>Verify that the firewall is configured correctly with the following command:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>sudo ufw status verbose\n</code></pre>\n<p>You should see the rules that you just configured listed.</p><h2 id=\"step-8-configuring-timezone\">Step 8: Configuring Timezone</h2>\n<p>By default, Ubuntu 22.04 is set to the UTC timezone. To change the timezone, follow these steps:</p><ol>\n<li>Open a terminal window on each server.</li>\n<li>List the available time zones with the following command:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>timedatectl list-timezones\n</code></pre>\n<ol>\n<li>Set the timezone to your desired timezone with the following command, replacing ‚ÄúAmerica/New_York‚Äù with your desired timezone:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>sudo timedatectl set-timezone America/New_York\n</code></pre>\n<ol>\n<li>Verify that the timezone is set correctly with the following command:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>timedatectl\n</code></pre>\n<p>You should see the timezone that you just set listed.</p><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>In this guide, we have shown you how to automate the initial server setup of multiple Ubuntu 22.04 servers using Ansible. We covered the installation of Ansible, creating an inventory file, configuring SSH access, setting up sudo access, installing some common packages, creating a custom user, configuring firewall, and configuring timezone. With this knowledge, you can easily automate the setup and configuration of your infrastructure, saving you time and effort.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>If you are running a Debian 11 system and are experiencing slow performance or running out of memory, you may need to add swap space to your system. Swap space is a designated area on your hard drive that is used to temporarily store data when your system has run out of physical memory (RAM). In this guide, we will walk you through the steps to add swap space to your Debian 11 system.</p><h2 id=\"step-1-checking-for-existing-swap-space\">Step 1: Checking for Existing Swap Space</h2>\n<p>Before adding a new swap file, you should first check if there is any existing swap space on your system. To do this, run the following command in your terminal:</p><pre><code>sudo swapon --show\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you get no output, it means there is no existing swap space on your system.</p><h2 id=\"step-2-creating-a-swap-file\">Step 2: Creating a Swap File</h2>\n<p>To create a new swap file, we will use the <code>fallocate</code> command. This command creates a file with a specified size. For example, to create a 2GB swap file, run the following command:</p><pre><code>sudo fallocate -l 2G /swapfile\n</code></pre>\n<p>Next, we need to restrict access to the swap file to root only. Run the following command:</p><pre><code>sudo chmod 600 /swapfile\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"step-3-enabling-the-swap-file\">Step 3: Enabling the Swap File</h2>\n<p>Now that we have created the swap file, we need to enable it. Run the following command:</p><pre><code>sudo mkswap /swapfile\n</code></pre>\n<p>This command initializes the swap file. Next, we need to enable the swap file with the following command:</p><pre><code>sudo swapon /swapfile\n</code></pre>\n<p>To make the swap file permanent, we need to add it to the <code>/etc/fstab</code> file. Open the file with your preferred text editor:</p><pre><code>sudo nano /etc/fstab\n</code></pre>\n<p>Add the following line to the file:</p><pre><code>/swapfile swap swap defaults 0 0\n</code></pre>\n<p>Save and close the file.</p><h2 id=\"step-4-verifying-the-swap-space\">Step 4: Verifying the Swap Space</h2>\n<p>To verify that the swap space has been added, you can run the following command:</p><pre><code>sudo swapon --show\n</code></pre>\n<p>This command should now display your new swap file.</p><h2 id=\"tips-and-tricks\">Tips and Tricks</h2>\n<h3 id=\"customizing-the-size-of-the-swap-file\">Customizing the Size of the Swap File</h3>\n<p>You can customize the size of the swap file to your requirements. Just replace ‚Äú2G‚Äù in the <code>fallocate</code> command with the desired size (e.g. 4G, 8G, etc.). However, it is recommended to have a swap space of 2GB or less, depending on your system‚Äôs needs.</p><h3 id=\"swap-file-vs-swap-partition\">Swap File vs Swap Partition</h3>\n<p>You can also create a swap partition instead of a swap file. However, it is recommended to use a swap file as it is easier to resize and manage.</p><h3 id=\"adding-too-much-swap-space\">Adding Too Much Swap Space</h3>\n<p>Adding too much swap space can actually slow down your system, as the system will start using the swap space instead of physical memory. It is recommended to have a swap space of 2GB or less, depending on your system‚Äôs needs.</p><h3 id=\"verifying-swap-space-usage\">Verifying Swap Space Usage</h3>\n<p>To verify how much swap space is being used, run the following command:</p><pre><code>sudo swapon --summary\n</code></pre>\n<p>This command will show you the amount of swap space being used, as well as the total amount of swap space available.</p><h3 id=\"removing-swap-space\">Removing Swap Space</h3>\n<p>If you no longer need the swap space, you can remove it by running the following commands:</p><pre><code>sudo swapoff /swapfile\nsudo rm /swapfile\n</code></pre>\n<p>Congratulations! You have successfully added swap space to your Debian 11 system.</p>",

Nginx logs all the requests that are processed by the server. These logs can be useful for troubleshooting issues with the server, analyzing traffic patterns, and monitoring server activity. However, if the logs are not properly configured and rotated, they can consume too much disk space and make it difficult to analyze the logs over time. In this guide, we will show you how to configure logging and log rotation in Nginx on an Ubuntu 22 and Debian Server 12.</p><h2 id=\"step-1-configuring-nginx-logging\">Step 1: Configuring Nginx Logging</h2>\n<p>Nginx logs all the requests that are processed by the server. By default, Nginx logs all the requests to the error log file. However, it is recommended to configure separate access and error log files to make it easier to analyze the logs.</p><ol>\n<li><p>Open the Nginx configuration file <code>/etc/nginx/nginx.conf</code> using a text editor. You can use any text editor of your choice, such as <code>nano</code>, <code>vim</code>, or <code>emacs</code>.</p><pre><code>sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li><p>Locate the <code>http</code> block in the configuration file. This block contains the main configuration for the HTTP server.</p></li>\n<li><p>Add the following lines to the <code>http</code> block to enable logging:\nThis will create two log files: <code>/var/log/nginx/access.log</code> for all access logs and <code>/var/log/nginx/error.log</code> for all error logs.</p><pre><code>access_log  /var/log/nginx/access.log;\nerror_log  /var/log/nginx/error.log;\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li><p>Save the changes and exit the text editor.</p></li>\n<li><p>Restart Nginx to apply the changes:</p><pre><code>sudo systemctl restart nginx\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"step-2-configuring-log-rotation\">Step 2: Configuring Log Rotation</h2>\n<p>Log rotation is the process of archiving old log files and creating new ones to prevent disk space issues. In Nginx, log rotation can be configured using the <code>logrotate</code> utility. The <code>logrotate</code> utility is a system tool that can be used to manage log files.</p><ol>\n<li><p>Create a new log rotation configuration file for Nginx:</p><pre><code>sudo nano /etc/logrotate.d/nginx\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li><p>Add the following lines to the file:\nThis configuration will rotate the logs daily, keep 52 rotated logs, compress the rotated logs, delay compression until the next rotation, and create new log files with permissions <code>0640</code> owned by the <code>www-data</code> and <code>adm</code> groups.</p><pre><code>/var/log/nginx/*.log {\n    daily\n    missingok\n    rotate 52\n    compress\n    delaycompress\n    notifempty\n    create 0640 www-data adm\n    sharedscripts\n    postrotate\n        [ -f /run/nginx.pid ] &amp;&amp; kill -USR1 `cat /run/nginx.pid`\n    endscript\n}\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li><p>Save the changes and exit the text editor.</p></li>\n<li><p>Test the log rotation configuration:\nThis command will force a log rotation and print any errors to the console.</p><pre><code>sudo logrotate -f /etc/logrotate.d/nginx\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"tips-and-tricks\">Tips and Tricks</h2>\n<h3 id=\"real-time-nginx-logs\">Real-time Nginx logs</h3>\n<p>To view the Nginx logs in real-time, use the <code>tail</code> command:</p><pre><code>tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log\ntail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>tail</code> command will display the last few lines of the log file and wait for new lines to be added to the file. This is useful for monitoring the logs in real-time.</p><h3 id=\"analyzing-nginx-logs\">Analyzing Nginx logs</h3>\n<p>To analyze the Nginx logs, use a log analyzer like <code>goaccess</code>. <code>goaccess</code> is a command-line tool that can be used to generate reports from log files. <code>goaccess</code> can generate reports in HTML, JSON, or CSV format.</p><p>To install <code>goaccess</code> on Ubuntu 22 or Debian Server 12, run the following command:</p><pre><code>sudo apt install goaccess\n</code></pre>\n<p>To generate an HTML report from the access log, run the following command:</p><pre><code>goaccess /var/log/nginx/access.log -o /var/www/html/report.html --log-format=COMBINED\n</code></pre>\n<p>This command will generate an HTML report from the access log and save it to <code>/var/www/html/report.html</code>.</p><h3 id=\"excluding-specific-requests-from-being-logged\">Excluding specific requests from being logged</h3>\n<p>To exclude specific requests from being logged, use the <code>map</code> directive in the Nginx configuration file. The <code>map</code> directive can be used to define a variable that can be used in the configuration file.</p><p>For example, to exclude requests that match the regular expression <code>~*^/admin</code> from being logged, add the following configuration to the Nginx configuration file:</p><pre><code>map $request_uri $loggable {\n    default 1;\n    ~*^/admin 0;\n}\nserver {\n    ...\n    access_log  /var/log/nginx/access.log combined if=$loggable;\n    ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This configuration will exclude requests that match the regular expression <code>~*^/admin</code> from being logged.</p><h3 id=\"customizing-log-formats\">Customizing log formats</h3>\n<p>By default, Nginx uses the <code>combined</code> log format, which includes the client IP address, request time, request method, request URL, HTTP version, status code, size of the response, referrer, and user agent. However, you can customize the log format to include only the information that you need.</p><p>To customize the log format, modify the <code>access_log</code> directive in the Nginx configuration file. For example, to include only the client IP address, request time, request URL, and user agent, add the following line to the <code>http</code> block in the Nginx configuration file:</p><pre><code>log_format  mylog  &#39;$remote_addr - $time_local - &quot;$request&quot; - &quot;$http_user_agent&quot;&#39;;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then, update the <code>access_log</code> directive to use the new log format:</p><pre><code>access_log  /var/log/nginx/access.log mylog;\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will create a log file at <code>/var/log/nginx/access.log</code> using the <code>mylog</code> log format.</p><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>In this guide, we have shown you how to configure logging and log rotation in Nginx on an Ubuntu 22 and Debian Server 12. By following these steps, you can ensure that your Nginx logs are properly configured and rotated to prevent disk space issues and make it easier to analyze the logs when troubleshooting issues. We have also provided some tips and tricks to help you monitor and analyze the logs, customize log formats, and exclude specific requests from being logged.</p>",

            "content_html": "\n  <p>\n    PM2 is a fantastic process manager designed specifically for Node.js applications.<br><br>Throughout my journey as a web developer, I've worked extensively with Node.js. I've had to schedule and manage a multitude of Node.js applications using CRON, which, let me tell you, was no walk in the park. That was until I discovered PM2! It was a game-changer, making my life significantly easier. PM2 ensures my apps are always up and running, and it automatically refreshes them whenever I make updates. Plus, it gives me the flexibility to manually set the reload time using CRON or adjust the restart delay for any application. The best part? It works seamlessly across all operating systems!<br><br>Now, you might be thinking, \"Is PM2 only for Node.js apps?\" The answer is a resounding no! While PM2 was indeed created with Node.js applications in mind, its utility isn't confined to just that. After using PM2 for a while, I discovered that it can manage scripts from any programming language! I gave it a whirl with Python, and guess what? It worked like a charm!<br><br>In this article, I'm going to share a practical example of how you can schedule and automate your Python scripts using PM2. So, buckle up and let's dive in!<br><br>Step 1: Update Your System<br><br>First things first, let's make sure your system is up-to-date. Open up your terminal and type in the following command:<br><br><code>sudo apt update<br></code><br>This command will fetch the list of available updates and then upgrade your system. The -y flag automatically confirms all prompts, saving you from having to manually approve each update.<br><br>Step 2: Install Node.js<br><br>PM2 is a Node.js application, so we'll need to have Node.js installed on our system. Here's how to do it:<br><br><code>sudo apt install nodejs -y<br></code><br>Once the installation is complete, you can verify it by checking the version of Node.js:<br><br><code>nodejs -v<br></code><br>You should see a version number as the output, which means Node.js is installed correctly.<br><br>Step 3: Install NPM (Node Package Manager)<br><br>NPM is the default package manager for Node.js and it's what we'll use to install PM2. To install NPM, use the following command:<br><br><code>sudo apt install npm -y<br></code><br>Just like we did with Node.js, we can check if NPM is installed correctly:<br><br><code>npm -v<br></code><br>If you see a version number, you're good to go!<br><br>Step 4: Install PM2<br><br>Now that we have Node.js and NPM installed, we can finally install PM2. Here's the command to do it:<br><br><code>sudo npm install -g pm2<br></code><br>The -g flag installs PM2 globally, which means you can use it from any directory on your system.<br><br>To check if PM2 is installed correctly, you can use the following command:<br><br><code>pm2 -v<br></code><br>If you see a version number, congratulations! You've successfully installed PM2 on your Ubuntu 22.10 or Debian 11 system.<br><br>Step 5: Set PM2 to Start on Boot<br><br>One of the great things about PM2 is that it can automatically restart your applications if your system reboots. To set this up, you can use the following command:<br><br><code>pm2 startup<br></code><br>This command will generate a command that you need to run with superuser privileges. Copy the outputted command and run it:<br><br><br><code>sudo env PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin /usr/lib/node_modules/pm2/bin/pm2 startup systemd -u yourusername --hp /home/yourusername<br></code><br>Remember to replace yourusername with your actual username.<br><br>And there you have it! You've installed PM2 on your Ubuntu 22.10 or Debian 11 system. Now you can use PM2 to manage and keep your Node.js, Python or Any script or applications running in the background.<br><br>Thank you for reading.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    \n  </p>",

But now, the office gave me another working laptop which is DELL, and sadly given the model doesn't have a hardware charging limit available and while it's plugged and charging at full, sometimes laptop gets hot and its bad if you live in tropical area like myself. üò©</p>\n<p>Anyhow, You can see limiting the charging can increase your laptop's battery life a little better.</p>\n<figure class=\"align-center\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/09/depth-of-charge.jpg\" alt=\"The ASUS ZenFone 7 and ROG Phone 3 support passthrough charging\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure>\n<p>So here I have a problem so I thought, What if I can build a simple plug as a charger solution that can be turned automatically ON when charging gets low or reaches a set limit and it will get off when laptop charging reaches above 90%. and vice versa. So it a simple and fun to build this¬†want to share this little project. üòé</p>\n<h4 id=\"mcetoc_1fani75hnn\">Get a SMART Switch</h4>\n<p>The first step is to get a wireless plug so I found the cheapest smart plug available on Amazon. which advertised as works with Alexa so without any research I thought it must work with everything. Boy! I was wrong but eventually, it worked out just fine, just went to my super helpful everyone's favourite friend who helped me to fix this kind of issue as always and you all know by its name \"google\". ü§ì</p>\n<p>So this Solimo Smart Plug has this app called \"Smart Life\" to set up¬†your device with your local centralized Wi-Fi router so you can talk to this \"IOT\" device from anywhere.</p>\n<p>https://amzn.to/354UpQW</p>\n<figure class=\"gmail-align-center align-center\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51-Q1%2BQbCDL._SL1500_.jpg\" alt=\"Buy Amazon Brand - Solimo Smart Plug, 16A, Works with Alexa Online at Low  Prices in India - Amazon.in\" width=\"465\" height=\"465\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure>\n<p>So I register myself on the app and proceed with usage turning ON and OFF.¬† Also, This app has multi-functionality like I can set it up like a timer but sadly I have to set up the timer again and again like Microwave or create a scene where I can connect to other services like location, temperature, etc. which is all fine but it's useless for the purpose and what I want to achieve.</p>\n<figure class=\"gmail-align-center align-center\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://www.ismartlife.me/images/ifttt@2x.png\" alt=\"Smart Life\" width=\"392\" height=\"436\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure>\n<h4 id=\"mcetoc_1fani75hno\">Create an account on Sequematic</h4>\n<p>If you are familiar with IFTTT it's simply \"IF THIS THEN THAT\" and my project is all about that so I wanted to find an option to turn the plug state from my laptop whenever charging is necessary. Then I found out that I can turn on the device through Webhook, where I change the plug state as I want and the webhook is available on IFTTT. Then I searched in IFTTT if there's an applet available for \"Smart Life\" and found some applets.</p>\n<p>Great !! but then the PROBLEM occurred, where it showed my plug is unavailable in the applet settings so I search about it and found \"Smart Life\" broke ties with IFTTT so I search more than found out about another app called \"Brilliant Smart\" and really it's not that brilliant which turns out the same <br>Table of Contents<br>1.

Get a SMART Switch<br>2. Create an account on Sequematic<br>3. Write or Download Bash Script for an automation.<br>4. Cronjob for scheduled task run.<br><br>failure as \"Smart Life\" then I went again for help on the internet and finally someone on Reddit said that there's another website which still can access \"Smart Life\" API and that site is \"<a href=\"https://sequematic.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sequematic</a>\" which finally done all the work for me.</p>\n<p>Sequematic is really easy to set up so I created a step by creating a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">webhook</a> where I gave the state name as a \"turn_on\" and set parameter \"on\" and another step I have added a switch to turn on whenever a POST request on the web-hook is being sent.</p>\n<figure class=\"align-center\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://www.fanjoe.be/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SEQUEmatic-06.png\" alt=\"Lier Smart Life / Tuya √† IFTTT apr√®s le 26 mai 2020 | Fanjoe&amp;#39;s website...\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure>\n<p>In the above screenshot, you can see two sequences are created which are \"socket-switch-on\" and \"socket-switch-off\". In those sequences, two steps have been created.</p>\n<p>Cool !! Now my plug can be turned on from the internet using just a POST request. It was so simple so what now? How can I turn it on whenever my laptop needs charging?</p>\n<h4 id=\"mcetoc_1fani75hnp\">Write or Download Bash Script for an automation.</h4>\n<p>As always I wrote a very simple bash script [ Literally, It is very simple ], Check it out.</p>\n<pre>#!/bin/bash <br><br># get battery percentage <br><br>battery_current_charge=$(upower -i $(upower -e | grep '/battery') | grep --color=never -E percentage|xargs|cut -d' ' -f2|sed s/%//) <br><br># check if battery percentage with your set value, mine is 40 <br><br>if [[ $battery_current_charge -le \"40\" ]]; then <br><br># if you using Ubuntu then below notify command will show you notification notify-send \"Auto Charging\" \"Script Executed!\" <br>#This will trigger switch on if condition is satisfied <br><br>curl -X POST https://sequematic.com/trigger-ifttt-webhook/your-id//switch_on &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 <br>fi <br><br>if [[ $battery_current_charge -ge \"90\" ]]; then <br># This condition will turn off the charging when limit hit to 90 curl -X POST https://sequematic.com/trigger-ifttt-webhook/your-id//switch_off &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 <br>fi</pre>\n<p>So if you have some Linux experience then you can understand from the shell script that I have created two if conditions and in the first condition, it compares the current battery percentage to start the plug when the battery reaches below or equal to 40%.</p>\n<p>The second condition when the battery percentage reaches above or equal to 90% smart plug should automatically turn off.</p>\n<p>In the shell script, the¬†URL taken from sequematic can change the plug state when the condition is satisfied so you need to replace both of your¬†<a href=\"https://ifttt.com\">IFTTT</a> URLs from the sequematic link in the script.</p>\n<h4 id=\"mcetoc_1fani75hnq\">Cronjob for scheduled task run.</h4>\n<p>This is a simple task given in a simple script but how can this script know every time this battery value changes?</p>\n<p>As always, Linux has inbuilt tools like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cron</a>, Where, I have given a timer to run this script for every 5 min to check battery percentage and the script will check its logic.</p>\n<p>Check out the below cronjob.</p>\n<p>¬†</p>\n<pre>*/5 * * * * bash charge-battery-script.sh</pre>\n<p>Voila!! It worked like magic.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I always use Ubuntu as my daily driver OS so it was a piece of cake for me to automate this process and if you want to do this on your Windows then, I suggest you should turn on <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">WSL</a> Feature \"Windows Subsystem for Linux\" which of course enables Linux (Ubuntu) in your windows.</p>\n<p>I can think of many usages from this automation somethings like turn on smart lights or change the color of smart light, smart socket or plug activity from your laptop.</p>\n<p>¬†</p>\n<address>¬†Hope you found this article interesting and let us know your opinion if you have a way to improve it.</address>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Thank you for reading!</p>\n</blockquote>",
